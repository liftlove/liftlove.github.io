        <p><strong>My mornings:</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúYay, new day! ENERGY! Coffee ‚Äì what‚Äôs that!? Yoga! Slam weights! Chase Caleb! BAGELS! Cook all of the things! My pants fit! HAPPY!</p>

<p><strong>My nights:</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúYOU DID THIS TO ME! I HATE YOU! NO MORE KIDS! Chocolate! FOOT RUB! MOAR CHOCOLATE! MY ANKLES ARE HUGE! Is it bed time yet!? Why don‚Äôt my pants fit anymore!?!?!? MUST EAT ALL OF THE CHOCOLATE! FORKLIFT OFF THE COUCH PLEASE! Blog? PSH Yeah right! ZZZZZZZ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>Okay seriously though, let‚Äôs get down to business and get on with the fun preggo survey.</p>

<p><strong>How far along</strong>? 35 weeks..which means 2 weeks till full term. SOMEONE PINCH ME!</p>

<p><strong>How big is baby?</strong> All of the websites say around 5-6 pounds. I say, I‚Äôm carrying a teenager.</p>

<p><strong>How I‚Äôm feeling?</strong> I‚Äôm ready to have this baby! I can‚Äôt wait to meet our baby girl, kiss her squishy cheeks, and let Caleb hold her. He plays with my belly all the time, I think he knows what‚Äôs up. Plus I can‚Äôt wait to double the adorableness in this house! üôÇ</p>

<p><strong>Weight?</strong> Still huge. And still not measuring my weight at home (go me ‚Äì huzzah!). I‚Äôll find out at my doctors appointment in a few days.</p>

<p><strong>How I‚Äôm changing?</strong> Last update I said that one of the ways I‚Äôm changing is that I‚Äôm nervous about juggling two kids. A change from that is that I now feel this overwhelming sense of calm. I‚Äôve realized that it is what it is. Whatever happens, happens for a reason and I‚Äôm okay with that.</p>

<p><strong>What I miss?</strong> Still missin‚Äô the same ol‚Äô. I can‚Äôt wait to push myself in workouts and drown myself in wine. Almost there!</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms?</strong>¬† I get braxton hicks EVERY.SINGLE.NIGHT. They‚Äôre pretty strong and sometimes even painful. It has me worried that I won‚Äôt be able to decipher between braxton hicks contractions and real labor because with my labor with Caleb, none of the contractions were really consistent until the last hour before I delivered, and then they were all of a sudden right on top of each other. I hope I‚Äôll have a <em>clearer</em> labor this time. My last labor was 5 1/2 hours and if this second baby is any faster, I really want to make sure I get to the hospital on time. I just need to make sure I‚Äôm actually in labor!</p>

<p><strong>Cravings?</strong> Chocolate and fruit. Lots of fruit. And even more chocolate. **</p>

<p>**</p>

<p><strong>Food Aversions?</strong> After taking a food handlers course for my volunteer position for the Army today, I now never want to eat chicken or step foot into a buffet restaurant ever again.</p>

<p>**Supplements? Vitamins and minerals are essential to ensure that Braxton and I get the proper nourishment. A vitamin D supplement is suggested since I plan on breast feeding. I have also been supplementing 400 micrograms of folic acid each day.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Highlights this week?</strong> We got baby A‚Äôs clothes organized and the hubs took ‚Äúmaternity‚Äù pics of me! We‚Äôre too cheap to pay for professional ones and just wanted a simple picture to place in baby A‚Äôs nursery.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs it for this weeks update! To my local friends, there‚Äôs a lot going on in town this weekend so make sure you follow me on Facebook as I‚Äôll be sharing updates on all of the local shenanigans.</p>

<p>Have an amazing weekend!</p>
