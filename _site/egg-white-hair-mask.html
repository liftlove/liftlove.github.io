        <p>One of my favorite paths of the 8 limb path of yoga is Aparigraha, which means to let go and practice non-hoarding. This can be applied to all things in our lives but one of the ways I interpret this is by eliminating the “need” for useless beauty products on my shelves that sit there and inevitably collect dust 😉  I’ve always preferred to keep my beauty routine quick and simple and this avocado oil hair mask is just one of the many ways I do so. Plus, nothing beats shopping your own pantry for pampering treatments that are so easy to whip up on your own. I also love knowing that I’m not slathering a bunch of unrecognizable chemicals all over myself and that this is yet another yummy treatment where if it ends up in my mouth (just a taste haha!) I won’t keel over and…die.</p>

<p>So here’s that avocado oil mask I’ve been meaning to share for a while now. I use this to bring some extra life to my dry ombre hair and LOVE it. Hope you will too!</p>

<h2 id="avocado-and-honey-hair-mask-recipe">Avocado And Honey Hair Mask Recipe</h2>

<p>1 half avocado</p>

<p>2 tbs coconut milk</p>

<p>1 tbs olive oil</p>

<p>1 tsp honey</p>

<p>1 tsp coconut oil</p>

<p>1 egg yolk (use the egg whites as a mask for blackheads!)</p>

<p>(optional) if you have highlights and want to bring out the shine, splash of lemon juice</p>

<p><strong>Here’s why this mask rocks:</strong></p>

<p>Avocados are not only nature’s superfood, but a crunchy momma’s best kept beauty secret. Besides being delicious, the natural oils from avocado are light and moist just like our own natural oils, and because it’s so rich in vitamins it’s also been said to promote hair growth. And we all know egg yolks are chock full of nutrients which can be so beneficial for our hair. With all of it’s delicious fats and proteins, it’s naturally moisturizing for hair which makes it PERFECT for reviving dry winter hair. Finally, coconut oil, coconut milk, and olive oil add an extra boost of moisture, and honey acts as a humectant to lock in all of this awesome moisture.</p>

<p><strong>And here’s what you do:</strong></p>

<p>First, make sure no one is home to laugh at you.</p>

<p>Then, place the avocado, coconut milk, olive oil, honey, egg yolk and coconut oil into food processor. Pulse until a creamy consistency is formed. It should be the same thickness as a regular conditioner.</p>

<p>Then, starting with the ends of your hair, apply the mask and work your way up to your scalp. Place your hair into a bun, cover with a shower cap (or a plastic bag if you’re cheap like me) and then walk over to the bowl of egg whites that you exasperated from the yolk. Apply the egg white to your face (I just use my hands) and let it dry for a few minutes. Then apply another layer of egg whites and repeat this drying and applying process until you’ve used everything. Don’t waste that precious egg!</p>

<p>Next, grab a bottle of <a href="http://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/essential-oils/singles/lavender-essential-oil">lavender oil</a> or a candle, tweezers, your favorite nail polish, and walk your butt over to a massage chair (if you have one, I use a cheapo one from Sharper Image that I love), sit in your chair, turn on your favorite Pandora station, and then go to town grooming and pampering yourself. Have fun, you hot thang, you!</p>

<p>When you’re finally done fixing those brows and painting your nails, it should have been around 15-20 minutes. Hop into the shower, wash the egg white mask off with a natural soap, scrub down with my <a href="http://www.liftlovelife.com/natural-care-101-grapefruit-brown-sugar-scrub/">favorite grapefruit scrub</a>, shampoo and condition your hair and VOILA! You’ll feel (and look) like a million bucks…or at least just like a new mommy until nap time is over 😉</p>

<p>For those ladies who find that natural oils just aren’t giving your hair the boost you need, you might also try adding Biotin to your diet.  Biotin is great for improving the strength of your hair and nails as well the quality of your skin.  Not only that, Biotin also has many other health benefits you might not think of, like blood sugar regulation, keeping cholesterol in check, and promoting weight loss.  You can find Biotin in a multivitamin, B complex, or tablet form online or at many popular retail locations!</p>

<p>I’ll be back soon with my favorite lavender foot scrub!</p>

<p>PS. Keep in mind that “soon” is a relative term here 😉 And have a wonderful Memorial day weekend world, we’ve got more house projects and moving stuff to do here! BLAH!</p>
