        <p>Before I verbally make love to my running stroller, I need to announce the winner of my Hydracoach Interactive Water bottle Giveaway.Â  Congrats toâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>Amy Adelsberger!</strong></p>

<p><em>Email me your address and Iâ€™ll get the bottle to you pronto! Enjoy and congrats!</em></p>

<p>*<strong>*</strong>*</p>

<p>Now onto why Iâ€™m dedicating a whole post to something that has made my runs so much harder, but rewarding.</p>

<p>When I started researching strollers while pregnant with Caleb, I went <del>a little</del> nuts. For some reason, I became obssessed with all things strollers. I was fascinated by all of the different styles, brands, types, and impressed with all of the engineering that goes behind creating the almost perfect stroller. I even created a whole spreadsheet of pros and cons for dozens of the most popular strollers on the market, thatâ€™s how crazy I was about ensuring we got the most bang for our buck. Because letâ€™s face it, strollers ainâ€™t cheap.</p>

<p>So when it came to finding the perfect jogging stroller, I had high hopes for the popular Bob Revolution stroller that every momma and their momma talks about. We even drove all the way to a fancy stroller boutique in Raleigh to test it out. And while we loved how smooth the stroller ran, we had major sticker shock and couldnâ€™t justify the price of paying over $400 for a stroller that weâ€™d most likely only use for 30-45 minutes a few times a week. I know some moms are totally cool with investing that much into their runs, but I am not. I didnâ€™t see myself using the stroller to train for something crazy like an ironman, since I tend to only run 3-5 miles a few times a week. You all know how much I prefer the gym or CrossFit instead ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>And then I discovered the Joovy Zoom 360.</p>

<h2 id="inline-double-jogging-stroller-review">Inline Double Jogging Stroller Review</h2>

<p>It was LOVE at first sight. I was first attracted to itâ€™s huge 16â€³ bicycle tire wheels, I loved how different it looked from the plastic wheels on other strollers, and I loved how modern it made the whole bike appear. And when we test drove the stroller, it was SO incredibly smooth to push. It steered so effortlessly and moved like butter!</p>

<p>And then I released the canopy and discovered how humongous it was. This was a huge selling point for me because I wanted to make sure my babyâ€™s smooth as a bottom skin stayed perfectly shaded. My mom instilled in me from a young age the importance of sunscreen and shading your face from the sun so itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve always worried about for my future kids. I also understood how important a large and shady canopy would allow the baby to nap a little easier while in the stroller.</p>

<p>I was expecting Caleb in the fall but remembered how hot the summers in the Carolinas get so I wanted a stroller that I run at night with but still feel safe. The reflective stitching on the five point harness straps, the reflective tape on the hood and canopy, and the reflective lights on both of the tires definitely nipped that worry in the bud! The stroller comes in a bright red, black, and bright blue so of course I went with the bright blue because I figured if I was running at night, the stroller would be easier to see. Plus itâ€™s my favorite color, haha.</p>

<p>Another perk of the stroller is how tall the seat-back is. Itâ€™s made to accommodate taller toddlers which the Bobâ€™s actually donâ€™t. My husband is 6â€™2 and Iâ€™m 5â€™8 so I was pretty sure we were going to have a fairly tall baby. Lo and behold, our big guy is now 33â€³ tall and his head doesnâ€™t even come near the top of the canopy. Along the same lines, the stroller works with taller folks because the handle bars arenâ€™t set so low to the ground. My husband has no problems pushing the stroller with his gorilla arms ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>I will admit that itâ€™s a bigger stroller and I was worried about fitting the stroller into our truck in case we wanted to haul the Joovy to one of our favorite trails. Fortunately, the stroller boasts quick-release wheels that are super easy to take off and put back on. So when the wheels are removed, the stroller actually folds really flat and has a locking mechanism to stay locked and folded (loaded? haha).Â  And for us busy moms who hate fumbling with the incessant amount of baby gear having a baby requires, the stroller folds in half with just the pull of a string. Hear that? Itâ€™s a quick, one handed fold!</p>

<p>SOLD!</p>

<p>Finally, the last thing that did me in was how it already came with a neoprene parent organizer, a tire pump, AND a high quality rain cover. Itâ€™s a great deal considering all the accessories are included and with how youâ€™re forced to purchase these items separately with other more expensive strollers. This stroller only cost us $220 dollars with free shipping and I honestly believe that you canâ€™t beat the price for the quality. It costs half as much as other brand strollers, but runs the same (if not even better) then the big name joggers. Plus, itâ€™s a freaking awesome looking stroller that rides like a dream. And I can guarantee that itâ€™s a head turner â€“ Iâ€™ve gotten tons of questions about this stroller every time Iâ€™ve taken it out.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re an expecting momma, I highly recommend getting the Zoom if youâ€™re looking for a luxury all terrain stroller that doesnâ€™t cost a whole body part or three. Here are some specs if youâ€™re interested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stroller weight: 26.8 pounds</li>
  <li>Car Seat Adaptable</li>
  <li>Weight capacity: 75 pounds (!!)</li>
  <li>Recommended age: 6 months and older</li>
  <li>Wide seat with five point harness</li>
  <li>Reflective stitching and fabric on sunshade and harness strap</li>
  <li>Adjustable reclining seat position</li>
  <li>Front wheel swivels 360 degrees and locks inline for jogging</li>
  <li>Shock absorbing system</li>
  <li>Oversized sunshade and peek-a-boo window</li>
  <li>Made with aircraft grade aluminum</li>
</ul>

<p>And hereâ€™s a video! Donâ€™t ask me why I decided to make a video after I just finished running. I guess I was thinking about parting ways with it in search of a double running stroller so this was how I was inspired to bid adieu to it at the last minute.</p>

<p>And after watching this video, Iâ€™m realizing how sad I am to say goodbye to this stroller.</p>

<p>This stroller got me through rough mornings when I needed a break from being trapped indoors and when I needed to feel the sun on my face but still be with Caleb. It calmed him down even when he had his worst crying fits from reflux, and helped him nap on days where he fought so hard not to sleep. When my husband was deployed and I couldnâ€™t make it to the gym or to yoga, it was my only way to move and be outdoors at the same time. This stroller got me through some rough times and as we near the end of our journey here at Fort Bragg, Iâ€™m realizing just how much Iâ€™m going to miss the quiet moments Iâ€™ve had pushing this stroller with Caleb. I never thought Iâ€™d like stroller running but 15 months later, Iâ€™ve actually come to love it.</p>

<p>But alas, weâ€™re moving on to this next chapter of our lives with a move to Europe where space is limited and with another precious baby on the way. Itâ€™s time to say goodbye and sell this stroller (haha any local takers!?) and search for something that weâ€™ll make new memories with. If only the Zoom could turn into a double, I would totally keep it but since it doesnâ€™t, here are the two strollers Iâ€™ve narrowed our search down to:</p>

<p>**The Phil and Teds Explorer</p>

<p>** <a href="http://philandteds.com/us/Products/Push/Explorer#Overview">go-further-inline</a></p>

<p>**Mountain Buggy Plus One</p>

<p>** <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Buggy-Cocoon-Second-Black/dp/B004QXZD68/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361417116&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mountain+buggy+plus+one">stroller</a></p>

<p>Hereâ€™s why: I definitely want a double INLINE stroller instead of a double wide stroller because of how much we plan to travel in Europe, and I want to get our moneyâ€™s worth with a stroller that can adapt to a newborn and toddler and then grow with both kids. I also want a functional running stroller that is high quality, safe, andÂ  easy to use but Iâ€™m really having a hard time deciding between the two. And the clock is ticking!</p>

<p><strong>So anyone have any experiences with either one?</strong> Iâ€™ve tried the Phil and Teds (and even ran with it with a friendâ€™s two kids while I was pregnant with Caleb) but still would like some thoughts on the Mountain Buggy before I make my decision. Help!</p>
