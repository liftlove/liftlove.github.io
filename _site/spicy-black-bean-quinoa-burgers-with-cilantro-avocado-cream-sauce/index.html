        <p>Welllll, I WAS going to post about something else but on a whim tonight I decided to whip up these awesome burgers after a friend had mentioned making Andieâ€™s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.canyoustayfordinner.com%2F2012%2F01%2F04%2Floaded-quinoa-veggie-burgers%2F&amp;ei=ArlkUZevLYPc9ATTkIGoDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpYxyK1VVOw7DGFcwV0GX-GBHYUg&amp;bvm=bv.44990110,d.eWU">Loaded Quinoa burgers</a>. Iâ€™ve made lentil burgers mixed with walnuts, and plain black bean burgers but Iâ€™ve never made them with quinoa so I was intrigued and had to test these babies out. I ended up not sticking with her exact recipe since I have a hard time following directions, I simply used the black bean and quinoa idea and went to town playing with other spices.</p>

<p>As it turns out, they were awesome! So clearly I HAVE to share them, it would be a crime not to haha.</p>

  <p class="instruction">
    Saute onions, garlic, and bell peppers with a tbs of oil in a heated fry pan until softened. Add in rinsed beans and then add spices. Transfer mix to a food processor once cooled. Add in cooked quinoa and then pulse together until mixed evenly. Form into patties and place on an oiled and baking sheet. Cook for around 15 minutes on one side and then flip over to finish baking the other. If you have the pan oiled enough, it should be crispy on the outside, but soft in the middle.

<p>We topped our burgers with sharp white cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and used my all time favorite Kings Hawaiian sweet sandwich buns. We also had sweet potato fries on the side and used the left over avocado sauce to dip them in. To be honest, the fries were merely just a vessel to scoop more sauce into my mouth.</p>

<p>Boy, does that sound wrong ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>Anyway, remember my <a href="http://www.liftlovelife.com/ode-to-my-jogging-stroller/">post where I confessed my love for my jogging stroller</a>? And then I asked about what kind of double inline stroller we should get in preparation for kiddo numero dos? Well we bit the bullet and went ahead with the Phil and Teds Navigator. We got it in a few nights ago and oh my word, LOVE at first sight! This baby is sleek, easy to put together and maneuver, light, and just plain pretty. And I really happen to like pretty things.</p>

<p>We took it out for a test run today and also loved how smooth it ran. As for our Joovy, I still plan on keeping it because Iâ€™m too attached to it and since itâ€™s specifically made for longer distance all terrain running, Iâ€™ll keep it around in case I want to take one kid out and train for something crazy. I just canâ€™t let go of that stroller quite yet.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a size comparison between the two:</p>
