        <p>Oh. My. God. My body. Touch my body! It hurts all over. And yet it feels SO good.</p>

<p>Okay yeah, because that whole first line wasn‚Äôt creepy at all. So anyway, last night I checked out Warm Yoga flow with some super sexy girlfriends of mine and HOLY AMAZING BODYGASM (there I go again with the creepiness)‚Ä¶.that class felt amazing. I realize I say amazing a lot but let‚Äôs be real here, I‚Äôm not pretending to be a literary genius with my words. Fine, it was incredibly stupefying (yeah, I totally didn‚Äôt use a thesaurus for that one). See, it‚Äôs better if I stick with what I know.</p>

<p>Back to warm flow yoga. We walked into a heated room, not bikram heated, because I won‚Äôt be doing any bikram while pregnant, but just enough heat that hits you when you walk in from the cold and you‚Äôre like ‚Äúwhoah momma‚Äù. That‚Äôs literally what I said when I walked in. Then we went through a series of intermediate to advanced poses all the while sweating our ass-anas off and trying not to fall and break our noses. There was incense burning, candles burning in the background, beautiful music, and basically a lot of muscle burning. The heat challenged my knocked up self, and my favorite instructor pushed us through various arm balances and inversions. At the end of the class, we were rewarded with the usual savasana where she walks around the class massaging our shoulders, giving us pillows if we needed them, and placing eye pads on us if we requested them.</p>

<p>It was such a sweet, sweet finish to a tough class, I just had to gush about the experience and recommend for all of you local peeps who want to get your yoga on, you MUST check out Sandra at <a href="http://www.embraceyogastudio.com/">Embrace</a>.</p>

<p>You can thank me later üòâ</p>

<p>We ended the night with some delicious hot chocolate, and girl talk while scaring the men sitting near us away. Last night was just what I needed after being cooped up all day. Hence my awesome mood this morning.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BC7ZZkd.jpg" alt="hot chocolate" title="hot chocolate" /></p>

<p>But enough about my awesome night with girlfriends. We need to talk about something else. Specifically, these delicious <a href="http://www.gnc.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=3998910&amp;sr=1&amp;origkw=total%20lean">Total Lean Protein shakes, Breakfast bars, and SafSlim</a> I was sent by the generous folks of GNC. It‚Äôs taken me awhile to get this review up because well, I actually wanted to try the products first.</p>

<p>Imagine that, trying a product before reviewing. I am so cool.</p>

<p>So the first thing I tried was the SafSlim. If you‚Äôre wondering what the heck I‚Äôm talking about, here is the product description from their website:</p>

<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      A revolutionary breakthrough in targeted belly fat science.¬†<b>SafSlim‚Ñ¢</b>, powered by SAFActive78‚Ñ¢, is the first-ever solution to target unsightly and health-threatening OMENTUM fat, the fat that accumulates around the belly region.*<br /> This patent-pending formula features a proprietary blend of non-GMO, expeller pressed, high-linoleic safflower oil. In a major university study on obese, diabetic women, the active ingredient in¬†<b>SafSlim</b>¬†significantly reduced belly fat ‚Äì 6.3% on average ‚Äì in just 16 weeks.*<br /> This ‚Äúbelly fat omega‚Äù has been shown to activate hormones, such as adiponectin, to help mobilize stubborn dormant midsection fat, curb appetite and improve insulin sensitivity.*<br /> Emulsified and ‚Äúbody-ready‚Äù for maximum absorption,¬†<b>SafSlim</b>¬†is the easiest and most effective way to transform your belly and ab flab‚Ä¶ naturally.*<br /> <i>* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

<p>Simply put, it‚Äôs supposed to really help with the spare tire I have from eating one to many donuts. Yes, I really have a fixation with donuts.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4ktz1hh.jpg" alt="safslim" title="safslim" /></p>

<p>In the two and half weeks I tried the SafSlim, I actually LOVED it. The flavor was delicious, tasted almost like orange sherbert ice cream, and I liked that it was just a spoonful to take. Easy to take, and easy to go down. I also noticed results pretty quickly. My stomach felt tighter, less bloated, and my ab definition definitely improved. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the SafSlim itself, or if because it was coupled with a clean diet (with the exception of original glazed donuts) and intense exercise but I will assure you that I absolutely loved the results. Admittedly, I was surprised, but very impressed.</p>

<p>I stopped taking it when I found I was pregnant for obvious reasons. But once I pop this sucker out, I will definitely be trying another delicious bottle of SafSlim.</p>

<p>As for the breakfast protein bars, I was sent Oatmeal chocolate chip and Strawberry cream. Normally I‚Äôm not a fan of these kinds of bars because I prefer to make my own food. But the flavor of both of the bars were too delicious to pass up and I started using the bars before my runs in the morning. They kept me full, but not disgustingly so, and did I mention they tasted like heaven in a bar? Yeah, they tasted like heaven in a bar. Oh, and they have 12gs of protein in each individually wrapped bar. Pretty awesome for such a tasty treat, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Finally, the lean shakes were the last thing I tried. First, I was completely enamored with the details:</p>

<h2 id="gnc-total-lean-shake-nutrition">GNC Total Lean Shake Nutrition</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Healthy meal replacement or snack</li>
  <li>25 grams of high quality protein</li>
  <li>170 calories</li>
  <li>24 vitamins and minerals</li>
  <li>Lactose Free</li>
</ul>

<p>And then I tried the swiss chocolate flavor and tried to marry the bottle. Anything chocolate is delicious to me but this particular chocolate flavor had me crooning. It was delicious, kept me even more full then the bars, and I loved the convenience of having a bottle ready to go after my workout. I didn‚Äôt use the bottle as a meal replacement because, um, that‚Äôs not how I roll, but I can see why it‚Äôs advertised that way. These babies satisfy you for hours. Yeah, baby. Oh yeah. Don‚Äôt stop.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll end the creepy blog post and review here though. I hope I still have readers. Hello? Anyone there? I am just in an EXCELLENT mood. But perhaps I should refrain from doing reviews when I‚Äôm this high off life? Eff it, GNC is awesome. Yoga! Hot chocolate! I need to get out more! Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Protein bars! Balls! Life!</p>

<p>And guess what I‚Äôm going to blog about next!? My mother effing homeland KOREA! Why? Because KOREA IS THE SHIT!</p>

<p>Off to bounce off walls now (run). Goodbye.</p>
