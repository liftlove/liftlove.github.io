        <p>Good morning world!</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve been in this hotel for 21 days now and with today being our last day, I realized our lives have been one big countdown lately.</p>

<p>1 day till we kiss this hotel goodbye forever (hotel tour)</p>

<p>2 days till we get our first shipment of our stuff in</p>

<p>1 week till I get my international drivers license</p>

<p>2 weeks till Caleb starts school</p>

<p>1 month till we get our car back</p>

<p>â€¦and who knows when I go back to school and start teaching yoga again.</p>

<p>To say that Iâ€™m excited is an understatement. I canâ€™t wait to make new memories in our little German home and Iâ€™m so excited to get started on decorating! I already have a whole shopping list planned out for Ikea and other stores here, haha. Sorry, hubs ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also glad to have escaped the pesky bees at our hotel fairly unscathed. I didnâ€™t mention it before, but we had a yellow jacket hive right outside of our window and since the Germans donâ€™t use ACâ€™s, weâ€™ve had to keep our windows open 24/7.Â  As a result, weâ€™ve dealt with a number of bees buzzing around our faces our entire stay at the hotel, one morning I even woke up to 4 stings on my foot and poor Caleb got stung on his nose. Thank God weâ€™re not allergic!</p>

<p><strong>ANYWAY</strong>. Hereâ€™s a recipe Iâ€™ve been wanting to share for awhile. I know I have a few expectant moms reading and this literally saved my raw nipples when I first started my nursing adventure with Amelia. Remember how I mentioned she was tongue tied? Yeah. That was no fun but thanks to my stubbornness and a little bit of this slathered on my ta-taâ€™s every morning, we survived and now at 8 weeks later weâ€™re still going strong with breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Obviously, you can go out and buy a $10.00 bottle of lanolin and that works just as well too. But I had these ingredients lying around, we were car-less since we had shipped our car overseas at the point, and I wanted to save money. So why not? Plus, itâ€™s always fun to make my own products, like <a href="http://www.liftlovelife.com/natural-care-101-grapefruit-brown-sugar-scrub/">my favorite grapefruit scrub</a>.</p>

<p>So hereâ€™s a homemade natural postpartum nipple cream for ya. &lt;pretty sure Iâ€™ll get an influx of spammers for that. Isnâ€™t it so nice of me to sacrifice a little bit of my blogging sanity for you guys? ðŸ˜‰</p>

<h2 id="nipple-cream-recipe">Nipple Cream Recipe</h2>

<p>2 tbs Jojoba oil or cocoa butter â€“ helps retain moisture</p>

<p>2 tbs Coconut oil â€“ promotes healthy skin regeneration, moisturizes, and fights off thrush and infection</p>

<p>1 tsp Olive oil (not pictured) â€“Â  acts as a moisturizer and is chock full of vitamins A and E</p>

<p>Pour all of your ingredients into a measuring cup, then melt for one minute. Mix everything together and then pour into your container of choice. I reused my old bottle of Earth Mamaâ€™s Angel Butter (which I loved) from my nursing days with Caleb. You can also get by with just coconut oil but again, I loved making my own.</p>

<p>So thatâ€™s it! Super easy and cheap. Itâ€™s also deliciously edible but I wiped off residue before nursing just to ensure thereâ€™s no harm done to my adorable little nipple nibbler, and so that Iâ€™m not slathering oil all over her face, haha.</p>

<p>Happy breastfeeding hot mommas! Wish us luck on our moving adventures ðŸ™‚</p>
