        <p>Is it any surprise that I am madly in love with Asian food? It doesn‚Äôt help that with this pregnancy I crave anything with the word ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù in it. I‚Äôm not complaining though, I love cooking noodles and I‚Äôm even more in love with how filling and nutritious most Asian foods are.</p>

<p>And I promise, you will definitely enjoy this dish. There is something about eating udon noodles that makes it so much fun.</p>

<p>In other news, I am now the proud owner of a Breville Juice Fountain Plus Juicer! I am so ridiculously excited to start juicing, my mom got us hooked while we were in Korea and I haven‚Äôt been able to get it out of my mind since.</p>

<p>Tonight we decided to test our new baby out and‚Ä¶.LOVE. That is all I have to say about our feelings. It was incredibly fast, efficient and super easy to clean. Needless to say, the husband and I were impressed.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" title="juicer" src="http://i.imgur.com/lT8kM41.jpg" alt="juicer" />In our juice: carrots, lemons, celery, collard greens, and apples.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  ¬†<img title="juice" src="http://i.imgur.com/XTfMyBE.jpg" alt="juice" /><br /> LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.
</p>

<p>Now I can‚Äôt stop daydreaming about all of the yummy vegetables I can juice. I know it‚Äôs recommended to use a few root vegetables, a watery vegetable, a green, a fruit to add sweetness, and a garnish for extra flavor like lemon, ginger, or parsley and I have a few ideas up my sleeve but I‚Äôm always open to suggestions. I just want to have some more fun with my brand new toy üòâ</p>

<p><strong>Anyone have favorite juicing recipes to share?</strong> And have a great Thursday! I‚Äôm off to bed early tonight because I have another pregnancy migraine‚Ä¶WOMP WOMP. Super fun times!</p>
